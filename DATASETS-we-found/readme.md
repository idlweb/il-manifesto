## Artificial Datasets
- Arcade Universe – An artificial dataset generator with images containing arcade games sprites such as tetris pentomino/tetromino objects. This generator is based on the O. Breleux’s bugland dataset generator.
- A collection of datasets inspired by the ideas from BabyAISchool:
- BabyAIShapesDatasets : distinguishing between 3 simple shapes
- BabyAIImageAndQuestionDatasets : a question-image-answer dataset
- Datasets generated for the purpose of an empirical evaluation of deep architectures (DeepVsShallowComparisonICML2007):
- MnistVariations : introducing controlled variations in MNIST
- RectanglesData : discriminating between wide and tall rectangles
- ConvexNonConvex : discriminating between convex and nonconvex shapes
- BackgroundCorrelation : controlling the degree of correlation in noisy MNIST backgrounds
